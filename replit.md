# AgroToken-StableBR Platform

## Overview

AgroToken-StableBR is a Brazilian blockchain platform for tokenizing agricultural assets (CPRs, receivables, harvest contracts) and managing a BRL-backed stablecoin (BRLx) on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. The platform integrates with Alchemy for real-time blockchain synchronization and features a Kaleido-inspired enterprise design system with blue-purple gradients and modern UI components.

The application demonstrates **REAL blockchain integration** with mock enterprise governance features, providing both asset tokenization capabilities for originators and investment tracking for investors, alongside **cross-border payments with REAL Sepolia transactions** and custody wallet management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Wouter for client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form handling
- shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens

**Design System:**
- Kaleido-inspired visual identity (reference: kaleido.io)
- Primary gradient: Blue to Purple (HSL 252,95%,62% → 270,85%,65%)
- Support for light/dark themes via ThemeContext
- Custom color palette with semantic tokens for blockchain states (confirmed, pending, failed)
- Typography: Inter font family for UI, Fira Code/JetBrains Mono for addresses/hashes
- Spacing based on Tailwind's 4px unit system

**State Management Pattern:**
- Context API for cross-cutting concerns (WalletContext, ThemeContext)
- React Query for all server data fetching with aggressive caching (staleTime: Infinity)
- Local state for form inputs and UI interactions
- LocalStorage persistence for wallet connection state

**Key UI Components:**
- AppSidebar: Navigation with i18n support
- ImportWalletDialog: Wallet import flow with encrypted key storage
- StatsCard: Reusable metric display component
- KaleidoGradient: Decorative background gradient overlay

**Internationalization:**
- i18next with browser language detection
- Support for Portuguese (pt-BR) and English (en)
- Translation keys organized by feature domain

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript in ESM mode
- Vite middleware in development for HMR
- Session-based architecture (though authentication not fully implemented)

**Blockchain Integration:**
- Ethers.js v6 for Ethereum interactions
- Alchemy SDK for enhanced blockchain data (Network.ETH_SEPOLIA)
- JsonRpcProvider connected to Sepolia via Alchemy
- Private key encryption using AES-256-GCM with session secret

**Smart Contract Architecture:**
- BRLxToken: ERC-20 stablecoin contract (Solidity 0.8.20)
- AgroTokenNFT: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for agricultural asset tokenization
- Contracts deployed manually via Remix IDE
- Contract addresses configured in blockchain.ts MOCK_CONTRACTS constant

**API Design Pattern:**
- RESTful endpoints under /api namespace
- JSON request/response format
- Blockchain transaction synchronization endpoints
- Mock endpoints for Kaleido enterprise features (governance, custody, FireFly workflows)

**Key Backend Services:**
- Wallet import/export with encrypted storage
- Transaction history synchronization from Sepolia via Alchemy
- AgroToken creation and portfolio management
- BRLx stablecoin minting/burning/transfer operations
- Mock cross-border payment processing with exchange rates
- Custody wallet management (hot/cold/institutional)
- Governance whitelist and compliance rules

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access
- Schema defined in shared/schema.ts

**Database Schema:**

1. **wallets**: Imported Sepolia wallets
   - Stores encrypted private keys (AES-256-GCM)
   - Fields: id, address, name, encryptedPrivateKey, createdAt

2. **agroTokens**: Tokenized agricultural assets
   - Links to on-chain token IDs and contract addresses
   - Fields: id, tokenId, contractAddress, name, assetType, value, maturityDate, description, metadata (JSONB), ownerAddress, txHash

3. **stablecoinTransactions**: BRLx transaction log
   - Records mint/burn/transfer operations
   - Fields: id, type, fromAddress, toAddress, amount, txHash, timestamp, status

4. **transactionHistory**: Unified transaction feed
   - Synced from blockchain via Alchemy
   - Fields: id, txHash, fromAddress, toAddress, type, value, blockNumber, timestamp, status, gasUsed, metadata (JSONB)

5. **governanceWhitelist**: KYC/compliance registry
   - Mock data for governance demonstration
   - Fields: id, address, kycLevel, approvedBy, approvalDate, status, restrictions (JSONB)

- Push-based deployment with `db:push` script

### Authentication and Authorization

**Current State:**

- Private keys encrypted at rest in database

**Intended Pattern:**
- Wallet-based authentication (connect wallet = login)
- Address-based authorization checks
- Multi-signature approvals for custody operations
- Governance whitelist for compliance gating
